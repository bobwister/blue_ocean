The pattern files in /media/scripts are used to set easily the pattern of bubbles.
There must be one value per line.

/// 1 - Note ///

The first line indicates the value "note" of the pattern. 
"Note" must be equal to 1, 2, 3 or 4, depending on the maximum velocity of the pattern.
If the fastest rythm in the pattern is a quarter beat, then note should worth 4.
If the pattern only goes on the beast, then the value is 1...etc.

Indeed the bubbles are all separated by 100 pixels divided by the value that you give to "Note".

/// 2 - Offset ///

The second value represents the offset of the first bubble of the pattern on the X axis.

/// 3 - Y coordinates ///

The following values are the different positions on the Y axis for each bubbles.
The value Y=-1 means that the bubble is invisible (i.e. there is no bubble at this position).
